# 🤖 Virtual Interview Assistant (LLM-Powered)

This project simulates a **virtual job interview** experience using a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM takes the role of an interviewer, dynamically generating questions based on the candidate’s background.

  The user provides basic information before the interview:
  - Name

  - Level (e.g., Junior, Mid-Level, Senior)
  - Work Experience
  - Target Company

- 💬 **LLM-Driven Interview**

- 📊 **Feedback System**  
  Post-interview, the LLM can generate a performance summary and feedback.
