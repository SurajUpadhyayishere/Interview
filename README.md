# 🤖 Virtual Interview Assistant (LLM-Powered)

This project simulates a **virtual job interview** experience using a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM takes the role of an interviewer, dynamically generating questions based on the candidate’s background.

## 🎯 Features

- 📋 **Candidate Input Form**  
  The user provides basic information before the interview:
  - Name
  - Role (e.g., Data Scientist, AI Engineer)
  - Level (e.g., Junior, Mid-Level, Senior)
  - Work Experience
  - Target Company

- 💬 **LLM-Driven Interview**  
  The model conducts a personalized interview based on the candidate’s provided details.

- 📊 **Feedback System**  
  Post-interview, the LLM can generate a performance summary and feedback.

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) – UI framework
